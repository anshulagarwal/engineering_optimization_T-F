	abstract="This paper reports on the development of a comprehensive framework for the analysis and formulation of bids in competitive electricity markets. Competing entities submit offers of power and energy to meet the next day's load. We use the England and Wales Power Pool as the basis for the development of a very general competitive power pool (CPP) framework. The framework provides the basis for solving the CPP dispatcher problem and for specifying the optimal bidding strategies. The CPP dispatcher selects the winning bids for the right to serve load each period of the scheduling horizon. The dispatcher must commit sufficient generation to meet the forecasted load and reserve requirements throughout the scheduling horizon. All the unique constraints under which electrical generators operate including start-up and shut-down time restrictions, reserve requirements and unit output limits must be taken into account. We develop an analytical formulation of the problem faced by a bidder in the CPP by specifying a strategy that maximizes his profits. The optimal bidding strategy is solved analytically for the case of perfect competition. The study in this work takes into account the principal sources of uncertainty---the load forecast and the actions of the other competitors. The formulation and solution methodology effectively exploit a Lagrangian relaxation based approach. We have conducted a wide range of numerical studies; a sample of numerical results are presented to illustrate the robustness and superiority of the analytically developed bidding strategies.",

Predicting workers’ thermal risk in indoor hyperthermal environments contributes to the health and safety at work and the control strategies of indoor hyperthermal environments. Moreover, the quantitative effects of heat acclimation (HA) on the thermal risk are unknown and the weightings of the factors influencing thermal risk need to be determined. To these ends, the simulation experiments were conducted in a climate chamber. The subjects were asked to do treadmill exercise to simulate manual labor. During the experiments, core temperature, heart rate, and subjective perception were recorded. Significant differences were found on the physiological strain index and perceptual strain index before and after HA, which indicate that HA could reduce the thermal risk. Air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH), thermal radiation intensity (TRI), clothing insulation (CI), intensity index of physical work (IIPW), and labor hour (LH) were selected as the predictors of the human thermal risk. Given the effect of HA, the non-HA and HA model were built using random forest (RF) with the accuracy of 95.15% and 94.01%, respectively. In addition, the weightings of six contributing factors were determined, and Ta and LH were the most important among them."

In this paper, we propose a conceptual redundant mesh network of smart devices (termed “smart boxes”), which are capable of harvesting their own energy from off-grid sources and operating in two modes: in normal mode, smart boxes act as data collection devices and enable smart city data to be shared through traditional IT services. Alternatively, during a catastrophic event in the city, smart boxes switch to emergency mode and provide a communication channel to first responders via the redundant overlay network they establish, without requiring any power from the grid. We provide a detailed research map to realize such a conceptual network, both from technology (i.e., communication, hardware) and policy aspects (i.e., institutional and personal policy adoption), including extensive suggestions for assessment of both technical and policy success, and incorporation of non-traditional smart city customers for smart city application data and services like first responders and emergency managers."

Different air distributions can generate distinct airflow patterns, thus affecting thermal comfort and ventilation performance. The experiments were conducted to study the performances of three air distribution methods (i.e. mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV) and stratum ventilation (SV)). Local thermal comfort was evaluated for the three air distribution methods with their individual thermally neutral temperatures. Three gaseous point pollutant sources located at the desktop, floor and manikin armpit respectively were applied to study the impact of the pollutant source locations on their ventilation performances. The distributions of air velocity, air temperature and contaminant concentration were measured. Results showed that a vertical air temperature difference of above 3 °C between the head and ankle levels appeared with DV, but the draught ratings (DR) under SV were higher than those under both MV and DV. Pollutant source locations exerted different effects on contaminant dispersion and contaminant removal effectiveness (CRE) for the three air distribution methods. SV always removed the contaminants effectively with all the three pollutant source locations to maintain good inhaled air quality, which was superior to MV and DV."

Smart city deployments have already begun to proliferate, as have the upsides, efficiencies, and cost-savings they can facilitate. There are, however, proliferating challenges and costs as well. These challenges include important technical questions, but equally important policy and organizational questions. It is important to understand that these policy and technical implementation hurdles are perhaps equally likely to slow or disable smart city implementation efforts. In this paper, a survey of the theoretical and practical challenges and opportunities are enumerated not only in terms of their technical aspects, but also in terms of policy and governance issues of concern."

abstract = "Implementing intelligent control strategies of building systems can significantly improve building energy performance and maintain or increase occupants' comfort level. However, these control strategies are dependent on the occupancy models. A good occupancy prediction model requires enough input data pertinent to the occupants' space utilization patterns. Nevertheless, most of the occupancy detection systems cannot provide this detailed information. As a result, most of the research works that considered shared multi-occupied offices did not distinguish between different individuals. Therefore, their practicality is reduced when they are used for open-plan offices. In this study, the occupancy modeling (i.e., occupants’ profiles) has been further enhanced using inhomogeneous Markov chain prediction model based on real occupancy data collected by a Real Time Locating System (RTLS). After extracting the detailed occupancy information with varying time-steps from the collected RTLS occupancy data, an adaptive probabilistic occupancy prediction model is developed. The comparison between the occupancy profiles resulting from the prediction model and the actual profiles showed that the prediction model was able to capture the actual behavior of occupants at occupant and zone levels with high accuracy. The proposed model distinguishes the temporal behavior of different occupants within an open-plan office and can be used for various levels of resolution required for the application of intelligent, occupancy-centered local control strategies of different building systems. This would eventually lead to a more robust control of building systems as well as more satisfied occupants."

abstract = "Demand-based HVAC control methods in buildings show great energy saving potential when accurate occupancy information is available. Appropriate service based on actual occupant demand could prevent unnecessary energy waste caused by system overcooling or overheating. Therefore, various occupancy detection approaches had attracted increasing attentions in recent years. Among them, Wi-Fi based detection approaches have been thoroughly discussed since Wi-Fi access points (APs) and wireless devices are ubiquitously used in modern buildings. Compared with traditional request and response based occupancy assessment, the newly developed Wi-Fi probe technology can actively scan Wi-Fi enabled devices even if they are not connected to the network. However, Wi-Fi probe detection still subjects to significant errors due to unstable signal and unpredictable occupant behavior. This study stresses the time-series and stochastic characteristics of detected signals and proposes a novel Dynamic Markov Time-Window Inference (DMTWI) model to predict reliable occupancy. The conventional Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are also examined and compared with the proposed approach. Also, an on-site experiment was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the results reveal that the prediction accuracy is over 80% when x-accuracy tolerance is less than 4 for weekdays, 3 for holidays, and 2 for weekend days."

abstract = "Energy consumption and indoor environment quality (IEQ) of buildings have been linked to human occupants. Predicting the number of occupants in a space is essential for the effective management of various building operation functions as well as improve energy efficiency. This study is the first to compare the performance of physical and statistical models in predicting occupant counts in a high volume lecture theatre (Occ = 200) using CO2 sensors. CO2 measurements and actual occupant numbers were obtained for 4 months to provide robust data comparison of the methodologies. It was found that that the dynamic physical models and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models utilizing a combination of average and first order differential CO2 concentrations performed the best in terms of predicting occupancy counts with the ANN and SVM models showing higher predictive performance. RMSE values for the corresponding models were 12.8, 12.6 and 12.1 respectively and correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.95. The relatively good agreement between dynamic physical model predictions and ground truth shows that the dynamic mass balanced model is adequate for predicting occupancy counts provided that the air exchange rates measured are accurate. Model average accuracies across all tolerance was between 70 and 76% demonstrating good performance for a large number of occupants. A discussion on the merits and limitations of each model types was presented to provide guidance on the adoption of various models."

abstract = "A data driven framework for the energy and comfort management in large buildings with multiple zones and dynamic occupancy patterns is presented in this paper. For such cases, precise heat conduction models derived using the classical thermal physics laws will be cumbersome. The approach uses the historical data to develop a multi-variable model through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) so as to identify the relative dominance of the direct and indirect effects of thermal coupling among the neighboring zones, occupancy and the external climate variations on the thermal behavior of the building zones. Based on the information gathered from the SEM, we can predict the return temperatures more accurately, which in turn is employed to incorporate a flexible control strategy for the HVAC system. A controller fed with the temperature error and occupancy error, between the predicted and measured values, regulates the supply air fan speed via VFD motor and outside air damper valve openings. This has resulted in the energy savings while maintaining the occupant thermal comfort at the reasonable levels. The framework proposed has been evaluated using real data collected from an HVAC system of a big airport terminal building. The results show that the accuracy of prediction is relatively higher than with other regression techniques; and that the HVAC system is energy efficient and can ensure occupant comfort on real-time basis in large buildings."

The non-uniform thermal environment of stratum ventilation challenges the dynamic control of the room air temperature. This study proposes a dynamic control method of the room air temperature for stratum ventilation based on heat removal efficiency. The proposed method requires inputs of only supply air temperature, supply airflow rate and exit air temperature, and can be readily employed by the building management system in practice. Dynamic experiments, with a wide variation range (i.e., from 24.5 °C to 30 °C), different variation rates (i.e., from 0 °C/min to 0.088 °C/min) and different variation trends (i.e., increase, decrease and steady) of the room air temperature, are conducted to validate the proposed method. The time interval of the dynamic experiments is 1 min. Furthermore, the effects of the cooling load and room occupancy are also analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The differences between the predicted room air temperatures by the proposed method and measurements are no more than 0.33 °C, and the root mean square errors are no more than 0.18 °C. Compared with the conventional method, which assumes that the room air temperature equals to the exit air temperature at the air terminals, the proposed method improves the accuracy in the room air temperature prediction by 79.3%–93.3%. The proposed method can be applied to dynamically control the room air temperature to meet the requirement of thermal comfort."

In commercial buildings, HVAC setpoints are set according to average comfort temperatures. However, individual temperature preferences may be different. The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making HVAC systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for HVAC systems. For a period of five months, the resulting learning-based temperature preference control (LTPC) was applied to a cooling system of an office space under real-world conditions. The four case study rooms consisted of typical office uses: single-person and multi-person offices. The experimental results indicate that occupant preferences in the individual rooms differ from each other in both time horizon and temperature levels. The results report energy savings of between 4% and 25% as compared to static temperature setpoints at the low values of preferred temperature ranges. Meanwhile, during LPTC, the need for occupant interventions for adjusting room temperatures to fit their preferences was reduced from four to nine weekdays a month to a maximum of one weekday a month."

The knowledge of occupant behaviour motivations is paramount for the design and implementation of intelligent control systems in buildings. This article presents a methodology to investigate the motivations for relevant actions in dwellings. It allows establishing their seasonality and the parameters that define them among other variation patterns. The methodology uses Spearman's correlation analysis to rank the candidate motivations for specific actions. Both continuous and categorical variables can be considered in the analysis, which allows taking into account a wide range of possible motivations. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study where the windows and the roller shutters opening in different rooms were monitored for one year. It was possible to establish the variation of the occupants' behaviour and depict motivations that had a seasonal pattern. The results highlight that the motivations for actions in a building system, performed by a specific set of occupants, can have significant variance depending on the room and environmental parameters. This dependence enables the determination of the seasonality effect. The obtained results also support the need to evaluate the motivations of occupants at a small scale (compartment scale). Following this strategy, a building management system (BMS) can adjust the operation of the dwelling to its occupants, and thus, achieve true building intelligence and optimisation of the energy efficiency."

ABSTRACT = {Sensor-based human activity recognition can benefit a variety of applications such as health care, fitness, smart homes, rehabilitation training, and so forth. In this paper, we propose a novel two-layer diversity-enhanced multiclassifier recognition method for single wearable accelerometer-based human activity recognition, which contains data-based and classifier-based diversity enhancement. Firstly, we introduce the kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA) technique to spatially transform the training samples and enhance the discrimination between activities. In addition, bootstrap resampling is utilized to increase the diversities of the dataset for training the base classifiers in the multiclassifier system. Secondly, a combined diversity measure for selecting the base classifiers with excellent performance and large diversity is proposed to optimize the performance of the multiclassifier system. Lastly, majority voting is utilized to combine the preferred base classifiers. Experiments showed that the data-based diversity enhancement can improve the discriminance of different activity samples and promote the generation of base classifiers with different structures and performances. Compared with random selection and traditional ensemble methods, including Bagging and Adaboost, the proposed method achieved 92.3% accuracy and 90.7% recall, which demonstrates better performance in activity recognition.},

ABSTRACT = {Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) based smart homes are proving to be an ideal candidate to provide better healthcare facilities to elderly people in their living areas. Several currently proposed techniques have implementation and usage complexities (such as wearable devices and the charging of these devices) which make these proposed techniques less acceptable for elderly people, while the behavioral analysis based on visual techniques lacks privacy. In this paper, a context-aware accurate wellness determination (CAAWD) model for elderly people is presented, where behavior monitoring information is extracted by using simple sensor nodes attached to household objects and appliances for the analysis of daily, frequent behavior patterns of elderly people in a simple and non-obtrusive manner. A contextual data extraction algorithm (CDEA) is proposed for the generation of contextually comprehensive behavior-training instances for accurate wellness classification. The CDEA presents an activity&rsquo;s spatial&ndash;temporal information along with behavioral contextual correlation aspects (such as the object/appliance of usage and sub-activities of an activity) which are vital for accurate wellness analysis and determination. As a result, the classifier is trained in a more logical manner in the context of behavior parameters which are more relevant for wellness determination. The frequent behavioral patterns are classified using the lazy associative classifier (LAC) for wellness determination. The associative nature of LAC helps to integrate spatial&ndash;temporal and related contextual attributes (provided by CDEA) of elderly behavior to generate behavior-focused classification rules. Similarly, LAC provides high accuracy with less training time of the classifier, includes minimum-support behavior patterns, and selects highly accurate classification rules for the classification of a test instance. CAAWD further introduces the ability to contextually validate the authenticity of the already classified instance by taking behavioral contextual information (of the elderly person) from the caregiver. Due to the consideration of spatial&ndash;temporal behavior contextual attributes, the use of an efficient classifier, and the ability to contextually validate the classified instances, it has been observed that the CAAWD model out-performs currently proposed techniques in terms of accuracy, precision, and f-measure.},

ABSTRACT = {Environmental sensors are exploited in smart homes for many purposes. Sensor data inherently carries behavioral information, possibly useful to infer wellness and health-related insights in an indirect fashion. In order to exploit such features, however, powerful analytics are needed to convert raw sensor output into meaningful and accessible knowledge. In this paper, a complete monitoring architecture is presented, including home sensors and cloud-based back-end services. Unsupervised techniques for behavioral data analysis are presented, including: (i) regression and outlier detection models (also used as feature extractors for more complex models); (ii) statistical hypothesis testing frameworks for detecting changes in sensor-detected activities; and (iii) a clustering process, leveraging deep learning techniques, for extracting complex, multivariate patterns from daily sensor data. Such methods are discussed and evaluated on real-life data, collected within several EU-funded projects. Overall, the presented methods may prove very useful to build effective monitoring services, suitable for practical exploitation in caregiving activities, complementing conventional telemedicine techniques.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, device-free human activity&ndash;monitoring systems using commercial Wi-Fi devices have demonstrated a great potential to support smart home environments. These systems exploit Channel State Information (CSI), which represents how human activities&ndash;based environmental changes affect the Wi-Fi signals propagating through physical space. However, given that Wi-Fi signals either penetrate through an obstacle or are reflected by the obstacle, there is a high chance that the housing environment would have a great impact on the performance of a CSI-based activity-recognition system. In this context, this paper examines whether and to what extent housing environment affects the performance of the CSI-based activity recognition systems. Activities in daily living (ADL)&ndash;recognition systems were implemented in two typical housing environments representative of the United States and South Korea: a wood-frame apartment (Unit A) and a reinforced concrete-frame apartment (Unit B), respectively. The experimental results show that housing environments, combined with various environmental factors (i.e., structural building materials, surrounding Wi-Fi interference, housing layout, and population density), generate a significant difference in the accuracy of the applied CSI-based ADL-recognition systems. This outcome provides insights into how such ADL systems should be configured for various home environments.},

We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level.

	abstract = "Smart meters are being rolled out in large numbers throughout the world, with proponents claiming they are a critical step in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Yet there are significant unresolved negative reactions to smart meters, principally based on the concern that smart meters might be used to infer the private activities that occur within a dwelling. Though smart meter data is classified as personal data, and as such protected under existing data protection frameworks in the EU, there are relevant exceptions, notably where the data is required for legitimate applications associated with the performance of 'regulated duties'. This paper contributes to this debate by examining the data requirements for some of the proposed applications of smart meter data within the electricity supply industry, and investigates whether the use of personal data can be minimized or even avoided. The discussion includes system balancing, demand reduction, demand response and distribution network operation and planning, and indicates that, for most of these applications, the requirements for personal data can indeed be minimized. 'Privacy friendly' alternatives are discussed."

	abstract = "Building occupancy is a paramount factor in building energy simulations. Specifically, lighting, plug loads, HVAC equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules. The identified occupancy rules and schedules are representative as four archetypal working profiles that can be used as input to current building energy modeling programs, such as EnergyPlus or IDA-ICE, to investigate impact of occupant presence on design, operation and energy use in office buildings."
