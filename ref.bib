abstract = "Implementing intelligent control strategies of building systems can significantly improve building energy performance and maintain or increase occupants' comfort level. However, these control strategies are dependent on the occupancy models. A good occupancy prediction model requires enough input data pertinent to the occupants' space utilization patterns. Nevertheless, most of the occupancy detection systems cannot provide this detailed information. As a result, most of the research works that considered shared multi-occupied offices did not distinguish between different individuals. Therefore, their practicality is reduced when they are used for open-plan offices. In this study, the occupancy modeling (i.e., occupants’ profiles) has been further enhanced using inhomogeneous Markov chain prediction model based on real occupancy data collected by a Real Time Locating System (RTLS). After extracting the detailed occupancy information with varying time-steps from the collected RTLS occupancy data, an adaptive probabilistic occupancy prediction model is developed. The comparison between the occupancy profiles resulting from the prediction model and the actual profiles showed that the prediction model was able to capture the actual behavior of occupants at occupant and zone levels with high accuracy. The proposed model distinguishes the temporal behavior of different occupants within an open-plan office and can be used for various levels of resolution required for the application of intelligent, occupancy-centered local control strategies of different building systems. This would eventually lead to a more robust control of building systems as well as more satisfied occupants."

Predicting the number of occupants in a space is essential for the effective management of various building operation functions as well as improve energy efficiency. This study is the first to compare the performance of physical and statistical models in predicting occupant counts in a high volume lecture theatre (Occ = 200) using CO2 sensors. CO2 measurements and actual occupant numbers were obtained for 4 months to provide robust data comparison of the methodologies. It was found that that the dynamic physical models and Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models utilizing a combination of average and first order differential CO2 concentrations performed the best in terms of predicting occupancy counts with the ANN and SVM models showing higher predictive performance. RMSE values for the corresponding models were 12.8, 12.6 and 12.1 respectively and correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.95. The relatively good agreement between dynamic physical model predictions and ground truth shows that the dynamic mass balanced model is adequate for predicting occupancy counts provided that the air exchange rates measured are accurate. Model average accuracies across all tolerance was between 70 and 76% demonstrating good performance for a large number of occupants. A discussion on the merits and limitations of each model types was presented to provide guidance on the adoption of various models."

abstract = "A data driven framework for the energy and comfort management in large buildings with multiple zones and dynamic occupancy patterns is presented in this paper. For such cases, precise heat conduction models derived using the classical thermal physics laws will be cumbersome. The approach uses the historical data to develop a multi-variable model through Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) so as to identify the relative dominance of the direct and indirect effects of thermal coupling among the neighboring zones, occupancy and the external climate variations on the thermal behavior of the building zones. Based on the information gathered from the SEM, we can predict the return temperatures more accurately, which in turn is employed to incorporate a flexible control strategy for the HVAC system. A controller fed with the temperature error and occupancy error, between the predicted and measured values, regulates the supply air fan speed via VFD motor and outside air damper valve openings. This has resulted in the energy savings while maintaining the occupant thermal comfort at the reasonable levels. The framework proposed has been evaluated using real data collected from an HVAC system of a big airport terminal building. The results show that the accuracy of prediction is relatively higher than with other regression techniques; and that the HVAC system is energy efficient and can ensure occupant comfort on real-time basis in large buildings."

abstract = "Stratum ventilation can energy-efficiently provide quality indoor air and thermal comfort. The room air temperature in the occupied zone is a dominant parameter for thermal comfort. The non-uniform thermal environment of stratum ventilation challenges the dynamic control of the room air temperature. This study proposes a dynamic control method of the room air temperature for stratum ventilation based on heat removal efficiency. The proposed method requires inputs of only supply air temperature, supply airflow rate and exit air temperature, and can be readily employed by the building management system in practice. Dynamic experiments, with a wide variation range (i.e., from 24.5 °C to 30 °C), different variation rates (i.e., from 0 °C/min to 0.088 °C/min) and different variation trends (i.e., increase, decrease and steady) of the room air temperature, are conducted to validate the proposed method. The time interval of the dynamic experiments is 1 min. Furthermore, the effects of the cooling load and room occupancy are also analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method. The differences between the predicted room air temperatures by the proposed method and measurements are no more than 0.33 °C, and the root mean square errors are no more than 0.18 °C. Compared with the conventional method, which assumes that the room air temperature equals to the exit air temperature at the air terminals, the proposed method improves the accuracy in the room air temperature prediction by 79.3%–93.3%. The proposed method can be applied to dynamically control the room air temperature to meet the requirement of thermal comfort."

abstract = "Heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) are vital components in providing a comfortable indoor climate for the occupants of buildings. In commercial buildings, HVAC setpoints are set according to average comfort temperatures. However, individual temperature preferences may be different. The purpose of this study is to explore the means of making HVAC systems respond automatically to local occupant temperature preferences. To create an occupant-centric indoor temperature environment, we propose an online-learning-based control strategy together with its design process. Four essential variables from four domains—time, indoor and outdoor climates, and occupant behavior—are extracted to construct datasets for preference models. A neural network algorithm and corresponding hyperparameters are suggested to model temperature preferences. According to time-dependent setpoints learned from dynamic contexts, a set of specified rules is used to determine setpoints for HVAC systems. For a period of five months, the resulting learning-based temperature preference control (LTPC) was applied to a cooling system of an office space under real-world conditions. The four case study rooms consisted of typical office uses: single-person and multi-person offices. The experimental results indicate that occupant preferences in the individual rooms differ from each other in both time horizon and temperature levels. The results report energy savings of between 4% and 25% as compared to static temperature setpoints at the low values of preferred temperature ranges. Meanwhile, during LPTC, the need for occupant interventions for adjusting room temperatures to fit their preferences was reduced from four to nine weekdays a month to a maximum of one weekday a month."

abstract = "The development of more energy efficient and smarter buildings must include the perspective of the occupants. The knowledge of occupant behaviour motivations is paramount for the design and implementation of intelligent control systems in buildings. This article presents a methodology to investigate the motivations for relevant actions in dwellings. It allows establishing their seasonality and the parameters that define them among other variation patterns. The methodology uses Spearman's correlation analysis to rank the candidate motivations for specific actions. Both continuous and categorical variables can be considered in the analysis, which allows taking into account a wide range of possible motivations. The methodology is demonstrated in a case study where the windows and the roller shutters opening in different rooms were monitored for one year. It was possible to establish the variation of the occupants' behaviour and depict motivations that had a seasonal pattern. The results highlight that the motivations for actions in a building system, performed by a specific set of occupants, can have significant variance depending on the room and environmental parameters. This dependence enables the determination of the seasonality effect. The obtained results also support the need to evaluate the motivations of occupants at a small scale (compartment scale). Following this strategy, a building management system (BMS) can adjust the operation of the dwelling to its occupants, and thus, achieve true building intelligence and optimisation of the energy efficiency."

We propose a holistic framework which incorporates different components from IoT architectures/frameworks proposed in the literature, in order to efficiently integrate smart home objects in a cloud-centric IoT based solution. We identify a smart home management model for the proposed framework and the main tasks that should be performed at each level. We additionally discuss practical design challenges with emphasis on data processing, as well as smart home communication protocols and their interoperability. We believe that the holistic framework ascertained in this paper can be used as a solid base for the future developers of Internet of Things based smart home solutions."

	abstract = "Smart meters are being rolled out in large numbers throughout the world, with proponents claiming they are a critical step in the transition to a low-carbon economy. Yet there are significant unresolved negative reactions to smart meters, principally based on the concern that smart meters might be used to infer the private activities that occur within a dwelling. Though smart meter data is classified as personal data, and as such protected under existing data protection frameworks in the EU, there are relevant exceptions, notably where the data is required for legitimate applications associated with the performance of 'regulated duties'. This paper contributes to this debate by examining the data requirements for some of the proposed applications of smart meter data within the electricity supply industry, and investigates whether the use of personal data can be minimized or even avoided. The discussion includes system balancing, demand reduction, demand response and distribution network operation and planning, and indicates that, for most of these applications, the requirements for personal data can indeed be minimized. 'Privacy friendly' alternatives are discussed."

	abstract = "Building occupancy is a paramount factor in building energy simulations. Specifically, lighting, plug loads, HVAC equipment utilization, fresh air requirements and internal heat gain or loss greatly depends on the level of occupancy within a building. Developing the appropriate methodologies to describe and reproduce the intricate network responsible for human-building interactions are needed. Extrapolation of patterns from big data streams is a powerful analysis technique which will allow for a better understanding of energy usage in buildings. A three-step data mining framework is applied to discover occupancy patterns in office spaces. First, a data set of 16 offices with 10min interval occupancy data, over a two year period is mined through a decision tree model which predicts the occupancy presence. Then a rule induction algorithm is used to learn a pruned set of rules on the results from the decision tree model. Finally, a cluster analysis is employed in order to obtain consistent patterns of occupancy schedules. The identified occupancy rules and schedules are representative as four archetypal working profiles that can be used as input to current building energy modeling programs, such as EnergyPlus or IDA-ICE, to investigate impact of occupant presence on design, operation and energy use in office buildings."

abstract = "Demand-based HVAC control methods in buildings show great energy saving potential when accurate occupancy information is available. Appropriate service based on actual occupant demand could prevent unnecessary energy waste caused by system overcooling or overheating. Therefore, various occupancy detection approaches had attracted increasing attentions in recent years. Among them, Wi-Fi based detection approaches have been thoroughly discussed since Wi-Fi access points (APs) and wireless devices are ubiquitously used in modern buildings. Compared with traditional request and response based occupancy assessment, the newly developed Wi-Fi probe technology can actively scan Wi-Fi enabled devices even if they are not connected to the network. However, Wi-Fi probe detection still subjects to significant errors due to unstable signal and unpredictable occupant behavior. This study stresses the time-series and stochastic characteristics of detected signals and proposes a novel Dynamic Markov Time-Window Inference (DMTWI) model to predict reliable occupancy. The conventional Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) model and Support Vector Regression (SVR) model are also examined and compared with the proposed approach. Also, an on-site experiment was conducted to validate the proposed model, and the results reveal that the prediction accuracy is over 80% when x-accuracy tolerance is less than 4 for weekdays, 3 for holidays, and 2 for weekend days."
